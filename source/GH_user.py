 Information:

    The purpose of this script is to serve as the main code for the user.
    Use the user's guide that still has not been written to find out how to use
    this tool.
    Use your python skills to understand how this tool has been coded.

    Change your variables, do your maths, and do your science.
    Let's go to space, y'all

    Process :
    1.  Generate the acceleration values (from orbit data or raw simulation)
            using GH_generate
    2.  Solve for the coefficients using the functions in this script
            using GH_solve
    3.  Generate a Geoid map from solved coefficients
            using GH_displayCoef
    4.  Compare Geoids or coefficients
            using GH_displayCoef
    5.  Plot Satellite positions and accelerations in space
            using GH_displaySat

todo: replace "acc" by "geopot" lol

future stuff:
    earth rotation
    approx drag and shit (solar radiation, tidal effects)

Here's whats going wrong:
    The acceleration generation function returns weird values.
    Just look at "Acc_sim" to see that the values are way too large
    What units are we dealing with here ?
    The data diverges as the time samples get longer

Also the solve functions generate completey different coefficients
than the originals, and it seems to diverge when the degrees go above 8. No, 5...

Also I have a huge doubt: am I confusing Acceleration with gravity potential?
